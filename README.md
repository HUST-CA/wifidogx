#wifidogx

Wifidogx is yet another(but improved) wireless authentication program similar to wifidog.

The program is mostly written in Lua, and based on [lask](https://github.com/spyderj-cn/lask).

The improved features are:
- Single-threaded mode with epoll as the I/O multiplexing backend.
- Powered communication protocol.
- Support https with the authentication server.
- Added ipset to manage firewall rules.
